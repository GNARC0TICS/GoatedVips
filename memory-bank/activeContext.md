# GoatedVIPs Active Context

## Current Focus

We are in Phase 1 (VS Code cleanup phase) of the GoatedVIPs platform optimization project. We've made significant progress in several key areas:

1. **Service Layer Implementation**
   - ‚úÖ Created client-side and server-side service layers
   - ‚úÖ Centralized authentication and profile logic
   - ‚úÖ Added comprehensive documentation to services

2. **Authentication System Enhancement**
   - ‚úÖ Refactored authentication hooks to use service layer
   - ‚úÖ Improved authentication middleware with better error handling
   - ‚úÖ Documented JWT token flow and authentication process
   - üîÑ Preparing for token refresh implementation in Phase 2

3. **UI & Layout Optimization**
   - ‚úÖ Created centralized style constants in `style-constants.ts`
   - ‚úÖ Implemented animation presets in `animation-presets.ts`
   - ‚úÖ Enhanced Layout component with accessibility improvements
   - ‚úÖ Added proper TypeScript interfaces
   - ‚úÖ Optimized image loading with lazy loading

4. **Profile System Refinement**
   - ‚úÖ Created centralized profile service for data operations
   - ‚úÖ Defined proper types for user profiles
   - ‚úÖ Standardized profile data fetching patterns
   - ‚úÖ Added proper ownership checks for profile editing
   - üîÑ Planning email verification implementation for Phase 2

5. **Admin System Security**
   - ‚úÖ Improved documentation of domain-specific routing
   - ‚úÖ Enhanced admin route component with better protection
   - üîÑ Preparing for audit logging implementation in Phase 2

## Recent Changes

1. **Service Layer Creation**
   - Created `authService.ts` for both client and server
   - Created `profileService.ts` for client-side profile management
   - Moved business logic from components and routes to services

2. **Authentication & Profile Improvements**
   - Refactored `use-auth.tsx` to use the centralized auth service
   - Added profile ownership check functionality in `profileService.ts`
   - Updated `UserProfile.tsx` and `QuickProfileCard.tsx` to respect ownership
   - Prepared token refresh mechanism for Phase 2 implementation

3. **UI & Layout Optimization**
   - Created centralized style constants in `style-constants.ts`
   - Implemented animation presets in `animation-presets.ts`
   - Added accessibility attributes to Layout component
   - Optimized image loading with lazy loading attributes
   - Enhanced component interfaces with TypeScript

4. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Created comprehensive Replit agent guide for Phase 2
   - Developed detailed loading performance optimization guide
   - Created layout optimization documentation
   - Updated Memory Bank with optimization strategies

## Current Challenges

1. **Performance Optimization for Phase 2**
   - Implementing centralized React Query configuration
   - Adding proper skeleton loading states
   - Applying resource hints and preloading
   - Optimizing component re-renders with memoization
   - Implementing server-side caching

2. **Authentication Enhancements for Phase 2**
   - Completing token refresh mechanism implementation
   - Adding rate limiting for auth endpoints
   - Implementing account lockout after failed attempts

3. **Email Verification Flow for Phase 2**
   - Completing verification token generation
   - Implementing email sending functionality
   - Developing client-side verification UI

4. **Admin Logging & Security for Phase 2**
   - Implementing audit logging system
   - Enhancing credential management
   - Adding bulk operation support

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Current Refactoring**
   - Refactor additional components to use service layer
   - Add documentation to remaining complex components
   - Enhance error handling across the application

2. **Prepare for Phase 2**
   - Finalize Replit agent guide with detailed instructions
   - Document remaining technical debt
   - Create detailed implementation plan for Phase 2

3. **Final Documentation Updates**
   - Complete service layer documentation
   - Document remaining architectural patterns
   - Create detailed deployment checklist

## Key Decisions

1. **Service Layer Architecture**
   - ‚úÖ Implemented centralized service pattern
   - ‚úÖ Separated business logic from presentation
   - ‚úÖ Standardized error handling and type definitions

2. **Two-Phase Implementation**
   - ‚úÖ Phase 1 (VS Code): Code cleanup, documentation, organization
   - ‚è≥ Phase 2 (Replit): Performance features, security enhancements
   
3. **Authentication Enhancement Strategy**
   - ‚úÖ Centralized auth logic in services
   - ‚è≥ JWT token refresh (Phase 2)
   - ‚è≥ Enhanced security features (Phase 2)

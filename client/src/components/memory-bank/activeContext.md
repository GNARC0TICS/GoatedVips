   - Prepared token refresh mechanism for Phase 2 implementation

3. **UI & Layout Optimization**
   - Created centralized style constants in `style-constants.ts`
   - Implemented animation presets in `animation-presets.ts`
   - Added accessibility attributes to Layout component
   - Optimized image loading with lazy loading attributes
   - Enhanced component interfaces with TypeScript

4. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Created comprehensive Replit agent guide for Phase 2
   - Developed detailed loading performance optimization guide
   - Created layout optimization documentation
   - Updated Memory Bank with optimization strategies

5. **API System Restructuring**
   - Removed redundant API routes from server/routes.ts
   - Updated supervisor analytics to use the platformApiService
   - Modified syncUserProfiles to use the platformApiService
   - Removed old transformation function references
   - Created proper separation between external API communication and internal endpoints

## Current Challenges

   - Applying resource hints and preloading
   - Optimizing component re-renders with memoization
   - Implementing server-side caching

2. **Authentication Enhancements for Phase 2**
   - Completing token refresh mechanism implementation
   - Adding rate limiting for auth endpoints
   - Implementing account lockout after failed attempts

3. **Email Verification Flow for Phase 2**
   - Completing verification token generation
   - Implementing email sending functionality
   - Developing client-side verification UI

4. **Admin Logging & Security for Phase 2**
   - Implementing audit logging system
   - Enhancing credential management
   - Adding bulk operation support

5. **API Resilience Issues**
   - Handling API timeout issues gracefully
   - Implementing better caching strategies
   - Enhancing error recovery mechanisms
   - Addressing timeouts with the external Goated API

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Current Refactoring**
   - Refactor additional components to use service layer
   - Add documentation to remaining complex components
   - Enhance error handling across the application

2. **API Resilience Improvements**
   - Improve error handling for API timeouts
   - Implement cache strategies for API data
   - Enhance retry mechanisms for failed requests
   - Add better user feedback for API connectivity issues

3. **Prepare for Phase 2**
   - Finalize Replit agent guide with detailed instructions
   - Document remaining technical debt
   - Create detailed implementation plan for Phase 2

4. **Final Documentation Updates**
   - Complete service layer documentation

GoatedVips.gg Telegram Bot

We need to build a Telegram bot that interacts with our affiliate platform and Goated.comâ€™s external API (if needed) to track and display affiliate statistics, wager races, leaderboards, and bonuses. The bot will be deployed in my Telegram group and should allow users to check their stats, claim bonuses, and see their leaderboard positions and be provided with updates, the bot will also be able to verify users once deployed, and be able to do this in a private chat with them if the user interacts with the bot itself. This is also how a user may claim a bonus code based on their performance or if manually granted by me. I as the owner should have complete control over the verification process and do so manually within the bot as users go through the verification process, the bot will simply ask them for their username on our platform and i will manually verify if they own the account or not.

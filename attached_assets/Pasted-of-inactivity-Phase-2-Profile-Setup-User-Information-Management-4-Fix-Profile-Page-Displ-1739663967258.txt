of inactivity.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Profile Setup & User Information Management
	4.	Fix Profile Page & Display Information
	â€¢	Ensure user details (username, email, profile picture, balance, etc.) are fetched correctly.
	â€¢	Fix inconsistencies in profile data updates.
	â€¢	Ensure editable fields work properly and save changes.
	â€¢	Check for profile image uploads, validate file formats, and ensure successful updates.
	5.	Ensure Settings Page Works as Expected
	â€¢	Allow users to update passwords, email, and other preferences.
	â€¢	Implement necessary verification steps for security changes (e.g., email confirmation when changing passwords).
	â€¢	Ensure changes persist after a page reload.
	6.	Notification System (If Applicable)
	â€¢	Ensure notifications (e.g., login success, profile changes, security warnings) are properly displayed.
	â€¢	Implement real-time notifications or a system where unread notifications are saved.
	â€¢	Allow users to clear or dismiss notifications.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Seamless Logout, Security, & UI/UX Fixes
	7.	Ensure Logout Works Properly
	â€¢	Logout should fully clear session or token storage.
	â€¢	Redirect users to the login page after logging out.
	â€¢	Ensure the user cannot access restricted pages after logout.
	8.	Fix UI/UX for Authentication Components
	â€¢	Ensure proper loading indicators (e.g., when logging in or signing up).
	â€¢	Fix any inconsistent button states (e.g., disabled buttons that never re-enable).
	â€¢	Ensure error messages are clear and well-positioned.
	9.	Handle Edge Cases & Security Enhancements
	â€¢	Prevent users from registering duplicate accounts.
	â€¢	Prevent session hijacking (e.g., using expired tokens).
	â€¢	Implement rate limiting on login attempts (to prevent brute-force attacks).
	â€¢	Ensure HTTPS is enforced if running on a server.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Final Testing & Debugging
	10.	Perform Full Test Cases

	â€¢	Login/Register Flow: Ensure smooth transitions and correct redirections.
	â€¢	State Management: Refresh page, log in/out multiple times, switch accounts.
	â€¢	Profile Updates: Change name, email, password, and check if it persists.
	â€¢	Security Check: Try accessing protected pages without logging in.

How to Implement This?
	â€¢	Start with backend fixes (Phase 1) to ensure API/auth logic is working.
	â€¢	Move to frontend state management (Phase 2 & 3) once login/logout is stable.

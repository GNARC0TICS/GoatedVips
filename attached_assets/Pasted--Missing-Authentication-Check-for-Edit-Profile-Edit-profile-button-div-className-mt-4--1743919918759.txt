 Missing Authentication Check for Edit Profile
{/* Edit profile button */}
<div className="mt-4">
  <EditProfileDialog user={user} onUpdate={refetch} />
</div>
The Edit Profile button appears for ALL profile pages regardless of whether the viewer is the profile owner. There's no conditional check to differentiate between viewing your own profile versus someone else's profile.

2. Redundant Data Fetching Logic
The components use different API endpoints for similar data:

QuickProfileCard: /api/user/stats/${userId}
UserProfile: A combination of /users/${userId} and /api/users/${userId}/stats
This creates multiple data fetching implementations that could be consolidated.

3. Profile Navigation Issues
While users can navigate from quick profile to full profile, there's no clear way to navigate back other than a generic "Back to Home" button, which doesn't maintain browsing context.

4. Limited Profile Features
Current profile pages show basic information but lack:

Achievement showcases
Activity history/feed
Social connections
Game preferences
Advanced customization options
5. Redundant Code Between Components
Both components implement similar visualizations and data transformations that could be extracted into shared components.

Improvement Recommendations
1. Implement Proper Own vs. Public Profile Views
// Add authentication check for edit button
const { user: currentUser } = useAuth();
const isOwnProfile = currentUser?.id === user.id;

// Then in the render:
{isOwnProfile && (
  <div className="mt-4">
    <EditProfileDialog user={user} onUpdate={refetch} />
  </div>
)}
2. Centralize Data Fetching with New ProfileService
Leverage the new profileService.ts we've created to centralize all profile data fetching:

// Replace multiple fetch calls with:
const { data: profileData, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: [`/profile/${userId}`],
  queryFn: () => profileService.getCompleteUserProfile(userId)
});
3. Enhance UI for Better Navigation
Add contextual navigation that maintains browsing history:

<Button
  variant="ghost"
  size="sm"
  className="absolute top-8 left-4 bg-[#1A1B21]/40 hover:bg-[#1A1B21]/70 gap-2"
  onClick={() => window.history.back()}
>
  <ArrowLeft className="h-4 w-4" />
  Back
</Button>
4. Add New Profile Features
Achievement Section: Showcase notable milestones
Activity Feed: Recent wagers or challenges
Social Connections: Friends or connections within the platform
Enhanced Customization: More profile personalization options
5. Optimize Performance
Implement proper loading states and skeleton screens
Add error boundaries for more resilient rendering
Use proper component memoization where appropriate

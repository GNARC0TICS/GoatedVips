If the "user not defined" error happens only when not signed in, then your authentication system is likely not handling unauthenticated users properly. Here’s how you can fix it:

🔍 Fixing user Not Defined When Not Signed In

1️⃣ Check if user Exists Before Using It

If user is undefined because the person isn’t signed in, you must check for it before trying to access properties.

🛠 Backend Fix (Express + JWT or Session)

app.get("/profile", (req, res) => {
  if (!req.user) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: "User not signed in" });
  }
  res.json({ user: req.user });
});

✅ Fix: If req.user is undefined, return an error instead of crashing.

2️⃣ Fix in React (Frontend)

If your frontend is expecting a user but the person isn’t logged in, handle null properly.

🛠 React Fix: Set Default Value

const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  fetch("/api/user")
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => setUser(data.user))
    .catch(() => setUser(null)); // Default to null if no user
}, []);

return (
  <div>
    {user ? <p>Welcome, {user.name}!</p> : <p>Please sign in.</p>}
  </div>
);

✅ Fix: Always check for null before using user.

3️⃣ Make Sure Authentication Middleware is Applied

If req.user is undefined, your authentication middleware may not be running.

🛠 Fix: Ensure Middleware is Used

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("User in request:", req.user); // Debugging
  next();
});

✅ Fix: If req.user logs as undefined, your authentication setup needs fixing.

4️⃣ Ensure Sessions / JWT Are Working

If you’re using sessions or JWT, ensure the cookie or token is sent correctly.

🛠 Fix: Check if Cookie is Sent

app.use(session({
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET!,
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: { secure: false }
}));

✅ Fix: Check if cookies are being sent and received in the browser.

✅ Final Fix Checklist

✔️ Check if user exists before using it
✔️ Ensure authentication middleware is working
✔️ Make sure JWT/session is properly set up
✔️ Debug with console.log(req.user) in the backend
✔️ Handle null user in React frontend

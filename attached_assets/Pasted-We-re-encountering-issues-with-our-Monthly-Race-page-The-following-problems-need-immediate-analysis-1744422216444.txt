We’re encountering issues with our Monthly Race page. The following problems need immediate analysis and resolution:
	1.	Race Status Flickering:
The page intermittently switches between displaying “Race Completed” and the active live race view.
	•	Investigate whether the race status logic properly reflects the current date and race lifecycle.
	•	Ensure the race is correctly flagged as active for April 11, 2025, and will automatically conclude at the end of the month.
	2.	Race Completion & Turnover Logic:
	•	Confirm we have logic in place to detect race conclusion, trigger a payout period, and initiate the next race cycle for May.
	•	This should include a seamless transition with appropriate UI/UX updates and backend data resets where needed.
	3.	Final Snapshot Requirement:
	•	Implement or verify existing logic that takes a snapshot of the top 10 users just before or exactly when the race ends.
	•	Ensure this snapshot is stored persistently in our database under a dedicated wagerRaceHistory or equivalent table/collection for audit and display.
	4.	Leaderboard Data Issue:
	•	The leaderboard occasionally displays $[object Object] instead of numerical values for user wager amounts.
	•	Audit the data mapping/render logic and ensure all numeric values (especially total wagers) are formatted correctly.
	•	Check for serialization issues, improper prop passing, or missing .toFixed() / .toLocaleString() methods where relevant.
	5.	System-Wide Audit:
	•	Perform a complete audit of our race lifecycle system, including backend schedulers/timers, DB schema integrity, frontend display logic, and payout execution.
	•	Ensure all components—from user tracking to leaderboard updates to payout handling—are synchronized and align with the intended monthly wager race flow.

Goal:
Verify that our monthly wager race is functional, currently active, and able to cleanly transition into the next cycle with accurate tracking, correct display data, and complete historical records saved in the database.

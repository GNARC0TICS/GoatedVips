Objective:
Review and refine the current login/registration button behavior and structure across both mobile and desktop views. These buttons should only be visible when the user is not authenticated.

Display Requirements:
	•	Mobile: Place login/register buttons inside the header navigation for immediate visibility and intuitive access.
	•	Desktop: Display the buttons directly below the header section.
	•	Visibility Logic: Ensure both buttons are hidden when the user is logged in.

Functional Workflow Review:

1. User Experience Flow
	•	What happens when a new user registers?
	•	What occurs immediately after login?
	•	Ensure both flows:
	•	Trigger appropriate UI updates (e.g., closing modals, updating header states).
	•	Store and retrieve authentication state persistently (e.g., tokens, user profile).
	•	Redirect or navigate the user to a relevant section (dashboard, homepage, etc.).

2. Onboarding Best Practices:
	•	Match expectations set by modern platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub):
	•	Smooth modal transitions between login and registration.
	•	Clear feedback on validation errors and success.
	•	Persistent login state across page reloads or sessions.
	•	Avoid flickers or delays in showing updated auth state.

Key Technical Considerations:

Event Handling:
	•	Confirm the onClick event for login/register buttons reliably opens the authentication dialog.
	•	If the dialog fails to open, check for issues in the modal trigger logic or event bindings.

Dialog Logic (AuthModal.tsx):
	•	Verify the modal initializes correctly, with dynamic switching between login and register modes.
	•	Ensure that UI state transitions (e.g., switching modes, form resets) are functioning properly.

Authentication Submission:
	•	Review the onSubmit handler:
	•	Validate API calls are functioning correctly for both login and registration.
	•	Confirm proper error handling, state updates, and loading indicators are in place.
	•	Ensure access tokens, session data, or cookies are saved and consumed appropriately post-login.

Testing Checklist:
	•	Mobile View:
	•	Tap login/register buttons—confirm dialog opens properly.
	•	Ensure proper placement inside the mobile header navigation.
	•	Desktop View:
	•	Confirm buttons appear beneath the header and behave consistently.
	•	Confirm they disappear upon successful login.
	•	Feedback & State:
	•	Show inline validation for errors (e.g., wrong password, email taken).
	•	Display success notifications or redirect as appropriate.
	•	Developer Debugging:
	•	Check for console errors during auth flow.
	•	Log and trace modal state (isOpen) and form submission steps.
	•	Validate state persistence with developer tools (tokens, cookies, etc.).

⸻

Final Notes:
	•	If functionality is still not working:
	•	Add logging around modal open/close logic.
	•	Double-check state management hooks or Redux context surrounding auth.
	•	Test edge cases (e.g., user already logged in, slow network, incorrect credentials).

By solidifying this process, we ensure a seamless and responsive authentication experience across all devices, aligned with user expectations and best UX practices.

Agent, please perform the following tasks:

1. **Thorough Analysis:**
   - Examine the entire codebase of this project, including every file, folder, and component.
   - Carefully study the website’s navigation, layout, design elements, text content, features, and overall user experience.
   - Analyze the backend functionality, data flow, API integrations, and any automation or webhook setups.
   - Understand how the program works, what its core purpose is, and the rationale behind the design and implementation choices.

2. **Comprehensive Documentation:**
   - Create a Markdown file named `APP_DOCUMENTATION.md` that provides a full, detailed explanation of the application.
   - The documentation should be written as if explaining the app to someone who cannot see it, ensuring every detail is conveyed clearly.

3. **Content Requirements:**
   - **Overview:**  
     Provide a summary of the app’s purpose, target audience, and primary objectives.
   - **Design & Layout:**  
     Describe the visual and navigational structure of the site, including:
       - The overall layout and how the pages are organized.
       - Detailed descriptions of the navigation menus, buttons, and interactive elements.
       - An explanation of the design aesthetics, including colors, fonts, and styling choices.
   - **Features & Functionality:**  
     Document each feature in detail, covering:
       - What the feature does and how it benefits the user.
       - The sequence of user interactions and the flow between different parts of the app.
   - **Backend & Technical Architecture:**  
     Explain the backend structure, including:
       - How the server-side components operate.
       - The logic behind data processing, API calls, webhook handling, and other integrations.
       - The technologies and frameworks used in building the app.
   - **Development Rationale:**  
     Detail how the app was built, including:
       - Key decisions in the development process.
       - Challenges encountered and how they were resolved.
       - Any noteworthy patterns or practices followed during development.
   - **Additional Observations:**  
     Include any extra insights about the code organization, potential areas for improvement, or future enhancements.

4. **Output:**
   - Once your analysis is complete, output the full content of the `APP_DOCUMENTATION.md` file.
   - Do not modify any existing code; your role is solely to analyze and document the current state of the application.

Please take your time to thoroughly review the codebase and ensure that every component and detail is documented accurately and comprehensively.

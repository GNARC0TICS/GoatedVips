Create a devguide.md file inside client/src/components/memory-bank/ that serves as a comprehensive development guide for continuing this project outside of Replit, specifically when using Visual Studio Code as the development environment.

The guide must include the following sections:

⸻

1. Project Initialization (Outside Replit)
	•	How to clone and run the project locally.
	•	Recommended VS Code extensions and workspace settings.
	•	Node version and dependency installation steps (npm install, pnpm, etc.).

⸻

2. Secrets Management Without Replit’s UI
	•	How to properly manage environment variables using a .env.local file.
	•	Explain how secrets like API keys or database URIs should be loaded into the runtime securely.
	•	Explicit Warning: Never commit .env.local or any file containing secrets to version control.
	•	Recommended libraries or patterns to inject secrets into both client-side and server-side logic without exposing them publicly.

⸻

3. Codebase Safety Guidelines
	•	Do NOT modify:
	•	.replit
	•	replit.nix
	•	package.json (unless additions are guaranteed to not break Replit build/deploy)
	•	Describe how to test changes safely using a feature branch workflow.
	•	Emphasize use of version control (Git) and PR reviews before merging sensitive changes.

⸻

4. Mocking & Data Integrity Rules
	•	Absolutely never create mock data that could mislead production behavior.
	•	All testing or development data should either:
	•	Come from pre-approved seed files, or
	•	Be dynamically pulled from a dev-safe endpoint or replica DB.

⸻

5. Database Instructions
	•	Connection details for local vs production databases (MongoDB, Postgres, etc.).
	•	Safe query patterns and expected data shape.
	•	How to restore or reset a local dev DB from production backups or seed files (if applicable).
	•	Mention of rate limits, indexing strategies, or migrations if relevant.

⸻

6. Environment Consistency & Tooling
	•	How to match the Replit environment (OS version, node/npm versions, build toolchains).
	•	If Docker or Vite is used, include sample command-line usage for consistency.
	•	Instructions for linting, formatting, and build validation.

⸻

7. Warnings & Best Practices Recap
	•	Never alter platform-specific config unless cleared by the core dev.
	•	Always test with .env variants that mirror Replit’s expected runtime.
	•	Always keep devguide.md updated after major environment changes.

⸻

8. Optional (if applicable): Git Workflow & CI/CD Notes
	•	How branches are structured and deployed.
	•	Where staging/production deployments happen.
	•	If using GitHub Actions or other CI, how to test workflows locally.

⸻

Use this devguide.md as a central source of truth to avoid configuration drift and maintain cross-environment stability between Replit and local development setups.

Plan for the Daily Bonus Wheel Spin Challenge

We’re building a visually stunning, ultra-smooth daily spin challenge where users can win bonus codes for various amounts.

🎯 Core Features

✅ Daily Spin Per IP Address – Only one spin per day per IP.
✅ Weighted RNG (Low Win Rate) – Most users get “Try Again,” while ~$1 wins happen ~1 in 10 spins.
✅ Prize Pool (Bonus Codes Only):
	•	🎉 $100 Bonus Code (Ultra Rare – ~1 in 5000)
	•	🎉 $50 Bonus Code (Very Rare – ~1 in 2500)
	•	🎉 $25 Bonus Code (Rare – ~1 in 1000)
	•	🎉 $2 Bonus Code (~1 in 200)
	•	🎉 $1 Bonus Code (~1 in 10)
	•	🎉 $0.10 Bonus Code (~1 in 5)
	•	❌ Try Again / No Prize (~80-90% of spins)

✅ Premium Look & Feel – Inspired by casino-grade UI, smooth animations, and satisfying sounds.
✅ No Crypto / Goated.com Integration – Just bonus codes displayed to the user.
✅ Cooldown System – Each IP is locked out until the next reset (UTC Midnight).
✅ Mobile-Optimized – Works flawlessly on iPhones & Android.

🎨 UI / Animation Plan

To make the experience casino-quality, we’ll use:
	•	🎞️ GSAP (GreenSock) Animations – Smooth easing for realistic wheel spinning physics
	•	💎 High-Res Visuals – Glossy, neon-glowing wheel with light reflections
	•	📲 Mobile-Friendly Touch Controls – Works with swiping gestures
	•	🔊 SFX & Feedback – Satisfying spin sound, clicking, and victory jingle

⚙️ Backend Logic

We’ll build a secure, fair, and engaging backend system to manage spins:
1️⃣ User Clicks “Spin”
2️⃣ Check IP Address – If they’ve already spun today, block them.
3️⃣ Weighted RNG Prize Selection – Randomly determine the outcome based on probabilities.
4️⃣ Bonus Code Display – If they win, display their unique bonus code immediately.
5️⃣ Store Spin Data – Log IP & timestamp to prevent abuse.
6️⃣ Reset at UTC Midnight – Users get a fresh spin each day.

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Frontend: React + GSAP + TailwindCSS
	•	Backend: Node.js (Express)
	•	Database: PostgreSQL (to store spin logs & bonus codes)
	•	Authentication: IP-based tracking (no login needed for now)
	•	Rate Limiting: Redis (to prevent spam/abuse)

🚀 Next Steps

💰 1. Set up the spin logic & UI
🛠️ 2. Implement the backend (IP tracking & bonus codes)
🎨 3. Polish animations, sounds, and mobile responsiveness
🎯 4. Launch & Optimize the prize distribution

🔥 This will be a retention-boosting, addictive mini-game that feels premium while keeping rewards controlled!

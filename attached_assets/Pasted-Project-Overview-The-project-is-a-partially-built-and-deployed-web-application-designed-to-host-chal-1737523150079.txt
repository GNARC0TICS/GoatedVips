Project Overview The project is a partially built and deployed web application designed to host challenges and giveaways for Goated.com affiliates. It currently fetches data from Goated.com's API to display leaderboards (e.g., weekly, monthly, all-time wager amounts) and includes a monthly wager race page. The site also has a login system but is incomplete, as users are encountering an "Internal Server Error" during registration. The project requires additional backend and frontend features to create a fully functional admin panel, resolve existing issues, and enhance usability.  Tasks for Replit Agent 1. Fix the User Registration Issue  Problem: Users are encountering a 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to register. Required Actions: Investigate the root cause of the error by reviewing backend logs. Fix any issues related to database interaction, input validation, or missing environment variables. Implement proper error handling for user registration to provide meaningful error messages to users (e.g., "Email already exists" or "Required fields are missing"). Test the registration process thoroughly to ensure reliability. 2. Build an Admin Panel  The admin panel will provide backend management tools for admins to monitor and manage the platform. Key features required:  Wager Race Management Allow admins to create, edit, and delete wager races. Races should include details like prize pools, start and end dates, and criteria for participation. User Management Add functionality to: View and search user profiles. Edit user details (e.g., update email, username). Deactivate accounts. Reset user passwords. Include user activity tracking (e.g., wager amounts, participation in races). Support Functionality Create a support chat system that allows admins to respond to user queries in real time when they are online. Display the admin’s online/offline status for users. Notifications Management Add the ability for admins to create notifications and push them to the website’s notification dropdown menu. Notifications should include a title, description, and timestamp. Bulk Email System Integrate an email service (e.g., SendGrid or AWS SES) to send bulk emails to all registered users or specific user segments. Provide a simple interface in the admin panel for composing and sending emails. Role-Based Access Control Implement role-based permissions for the admin panel (e.g., super admin, moderators, support agents). Admin Activity Logging Log all admin actions (e.g., user edits, race modifications, notifications sent) in the backend for transparency and auditing purposes. 3. Improve User-Facing Features  Login System Fix the login process, ensuring it properly handles authentication errors and provides user-friendly error messages (e.g., incorrect password). Add session timeout handling and a "remember me" option. Notifications Dropdown Ensure that users can see admin-created notifications in a dropdown menu on the website. Notifications should display the title, description, and timestamp. Registration Error Feedback Ensure users see appropriate error messages when their registration fails (e.g., "Email already in use" or "Password too short"). 4. General Enhancements and Security  Error Logging and Monitoring Set up error logging (e.g., using a service like Sentry) for both the frontend and backend to track and fix issues quickly. Database Validation Add constraints and validation rules to the database to ensure data integrity (e.g., unique email addresses). Performance Optimization Optimize API calls to Goated.com to reduce latency and improve responsiveness on leaderboard and race pages. Security Best Practices Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. Encrypt sensitive user data (e.g., passwords) and use secure authentication methods (e.g., JWT). Secure the admin panel with role-based access controls and additional authentication steps (e.g., 2FA for admins). 5. Testing and Deployment  Testing Conduct end-to-end testing of all implemented features (e.g., registration, login, admin panel functionality). Write unit tests for critical backend functions to ensure stability. Deployment Deploy the updates to the live server, ensuring minimal downtime. Verify that the updates work correctly in the live environment. Language Preferences Replit Agent Interaction: English Website Interface: English Additional Notes The website is already deployed and partially functional. The focus is on completing the remaining backend and frontend features while ensuring the platform is stable and user-friendly. Emphasis should be placed on error handling, logging, and security to prevent future issues.

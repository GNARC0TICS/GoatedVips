Here’s a list of specific workflow configuration requirements that we need to ensure before the bot starts handling requests:

Port Readiness:
The workflow must wait until the designated server port (e.g., port 5000) is fully available before initiating any tests or bot activity.
Use a setting like wait_for_port = 5000 (or its equivalent) to ensure the environment is ready.
Environment Variables:
Confirm that critical environment variables are set, including:
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
INTERNAL_API_URL (or equivalent for internal endpoints)
Any database credentials or other secrets.
Ensure these are loaded before the server starts.
Server Initialization:
The workflow should run the correct startup command (e.g., npm run dev or similar) as defined in the .replit file or your deployment script.
The startup command should properly initialize the Express server and the Telegram bot without conflicts (e.g., ensuring Vite doesn't intercept API routes).
Internal API Accessibility:
The configuration must confirm that internal API endpoints (like /api/wager-races/current) are accessible via the specified URL (e.g., http://0.0.0.0:5000).
This ensures that when the bot makes API calls, it’s receiving the proper, transformed data.
Health Check Mechanism:
The workflow should include a health check that periodically confirms the bot’s and server’s status.
Any failure in health checks should prevent the workflow from proceeding to the testing phase.
Logging & Error Reporting:
Detailed logging should be configured so that any errors during startup or API calls are captured and reported (for instance, via a Slack webhook or similar alerting mechanism).
This helps diagnose any issues quickly during the initialization phase.
By ensuring these requirements are met in your workflow configuration, we can achieve a stable environment where the Telegram bot and internal API endpoints are fully operational before tests or further interactions begin. Let me know if you need further details or adjustments!

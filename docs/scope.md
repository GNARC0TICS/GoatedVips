## [2024-04-30] Wager Race Logic Audit Summary
- Reviewed: WagerRaces.tsx, LeaderboardTable.tsx, useLeaderboard.ts, db/schema.ts, server/services/platformApiService.ts
- Strengths: Configurability (DB-driven), historical storage, clear separation of concerns
- Areas for optimization: Prize config should always be DB-driven, previous race logic should use real data, add DB indexes, implement winner notification, optimize leaderboard queries, add tests and monitoring
- See audit_checklist.md for new actionable tasks

## [2024-04-30] Platform Renovation Plan
- See audit_checklist.md for a detailed, actionable breakdown of all renovation and optimization tasks.
- Focus areas: Wager Race Logic, Account Linking, General Platform, Documentation.
- All new flows, endpoints, and admin tools must be documented here as they are implemented.
- The goal is a maintainable, high-performance, user-friendly app.

_Add new files, directories, and details as the codebase evolves._

## Backend Services (server/services/)

|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **wagerLeaderboardSync.ts** | Syncs Goated wager leaderboard to DB. Upserts wager fields for all users.             | Uses goatedApiService.      | âœ… clean        | Runs on startup & interval. No business logic, just sync.                                  |
| **telegramBotService.ts**   | Telegram bot integration. Handles `/start` and `/verify` commands, user linking.      | None                        | âœ… clean        | Singleton. No tight coupling. Minimal logic.                                                |
| **userService.ts**          | Central user DB service. CRUD, search, profile ensure, Goated linking, verification.  | Calls goatedApiService.     | ðŸ§¹ needs cleanup| Some overlap with platformApiService. Some logic could be further modularized.              |
| **goatedApiService.ts**     | Handles all external Goated.com API calls. Retry logic, token mgmt, error handling.   | Exponential backoff retry.  | âœ… clean        | No business logic, just API. Good separation.                                               |
| **platformApiService.ts**   | All internal business logic: transforms, syncs, race logic, DB ops, endpoints.        | Uses goatedApiService.      | ðŸ§¹ needs cleanup| Large, some tight coupling (API+DB+logic). Some duplication with userService.               |
| **cacheService.ts**         | In-memory cache with TTL, namespaces, stats, stale-while-revalidate, error caching.   | None                        | âœ… clean        | Good separation. Could be extracted to core utils if used elsewhere.                        |

### Refactor Checklist
- [ ] Migrate all direct DB/business logic in `users.ts` to `userService`/`profileService`
- [ ] Move analytics and user management logic in `goombas-admin.ts` to `adminService` or `userService`
- [ ] Enforce explicit auth/admin middleware in `account-linking.ts` and `challenges.ts`
- [ ] Add admin middleware to `/sync/trigger` in `apiRoutes.ts`
- [x] Keep `apiRoutes.ts` as a clean controller layer using proper services

### Refactor Checklist (Middleware)
- [ ] Replace all inline `req.user?.id`/`req.user?.admin` checks with `requireAuth`/`requireAdmin` middleware.
- [ ] Audit all routes for missing rate limiting (especially login, webhook, and admin actions).
- [ ] Confirm all domain-specific logic is handled via `domain-handler`, not in routes.
- [ ] Standardize error throwing to use `AppError` for all custom errors.
